# ListenTogether - Social Music Streaming Platform

## Project Overview

**ListenTogether** is a real-time collaborative music streaming platform that allows friends to create virtual rooms and listen to music together, synchronized across all participants. Think of it as a "watch party" but for music - everyone hears the same song at the same time, with shared controls and social features.

## Vision & Goals

- **Social Interaction**: Real-time chat, reactions, and collaborative playlist building
